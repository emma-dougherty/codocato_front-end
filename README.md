Note: This setup tutorial assumes that you already have installed a package manager like npm and the version control system git, and that you have IntelliJ IDEA installed on your system. Open your terminal and go to the directory where you would like to save the app in and enter in the following command:

  ``git@github.com:emma-dougherty/codocato_front_end.git``
 
Once the download has ended, run the following command:

  ``npm i``
  
To install the backend, run the following command (please note: do not run this within the same folder):

`` git@github.com:emma-dougherty/codocato.git ``

To begin, start up the backend server, by opening the backend folder in IntelliJ. After IntelliJ finishes loading the dependencies, /main/java/com.server.server, right click on the file named ServerApplication and click 'Run ServerApplication...main()'.

To start the Front End, go to its folder and run the following command:

`` npm start ``

Verify it is running correctly by browsing http://localhost:3000
